#  @brief Makefile for CloverLeaf
#  @author Wayne Gaudin, Andy Herdman
#  @details Agnostic, platform independent makefile for the Clover Leaf benchmark code.

# It is not meant to be clever in anyway, just a simple build out of the box script.
# Just make sure mpif90 is in your path. It uses mpif90 even for all builds because this abstracts the base
#  name of the compiler. If you are on a system that doesn't use mpif90, just replace mpif90 with the compiler name
#  of choice. The only mpi dependencies in this non-MPI version are mpi_wtime in timer.f90.

# There is no single way of turning OpenMP compilation on with all compilers.
# The known compilers have been added as a variable. By default the make
#  will use no options, which will work on Cray for example, but not on other
#  compilers.
